# ABSTRACT: Perl wrapper for the NewsReach API
=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $nr = WWW::NewsReach->new({ api_key => $api_key })

    my $news = $nr->get_news;

    foreach ( @{$news} ) {
        my $comments   = $news->comments;
        my $categories = $news->categories;
        my $photos     = $news->photos;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WWW::NewsReach is a simple Perl wrapper for the NewsReach API. It provides access
to individual news articles via the get_news() method.

Each news article [may] have associated comments, categories, and photos. These, if
present will be associated with the article and can be accessed.

Most of the non-optional data the API returns has been modelled by this wrapper but
no guarantees are made that ALL data is modelled.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 WWW::NewsReach->new({ api_key => $api_key })

Return a new WWW::NewsReach object.

# Construct some of the API URLs based on the root API response
# This is definitely slow but it's what they recommend in the docs:
#
# "It doesn't intend to imply how the API should be accessed.
# Your code should only have knowledge about the Base URL and API Key.
# Do not hard code resource URL logic into your software. Rather it should
# be discovered from the Root of the API."
